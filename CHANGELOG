0.05	28 April 2012
	Really reduced dependency on Perl to 5.10.0.

	Added support for persistent backends, and the FlatFile and DBI
	backends.  No tests for the DBI backend just yet, soon!

0.04	22 April 2012
	Reduced dependency on Perl to 5.10.0 (instead of 5.14.0).  Seems to
	pass fine with this older Perl.

	Fixed problem if hash would be filled with ID values not matching the
	offset / increment given at creation.  This may happen if a hash is
	filled from a database that has ID's merged with several different
	offsets.

0.03	21 April 2012
	Documented and tested the "offset" and "increment" parameters.  Plus
	some small code and pod tweaks.

0.02	21 April 2012
	Order of keys is now the order in which they were added.  This now
	bypasses the normal way of generating keys of a hash.

	Added support for autoflushing.  Initialization can now also be done
	by just specifying a hash ref.  More tests, including something of a
	performance test: on my MacBook it does ~110K new ID's / second and
	about ~400K existing ID's / second using the optimized ro_hash
	construct.

0.01    20 April 2012
	First public version of String::Lookup.
