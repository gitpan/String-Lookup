	Documented and tested the "offset" and "increment" parameters.  Plus
	some small code and pod tweaks.

	Order of keys is now the order in which they were added.  This now
	bypasses the normal way of generating keys of a hash.

	Added support for autoflushing.  Initialization can now also be done
	by just specifying a hash ref.  More tests, including something of a
	performance test: on my MacBook it does ~110K new ID's / second and
	about ~400K existing ID's / second using the optimized ro_hash
	construct.

	First public version of String::Lookup.
